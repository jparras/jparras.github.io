## Deep Reinforcement Learning teaching codes

* These codes are used for my teaching courses on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The codes are minimal implementations, intended for teaching, and available [here](https://github.com/jparras/drl_classes). The codes include:
    * Model-free methods: DDQN, VPG, A2C, TRPO, DDPG.
    * Model-based methods: AlphaZero.

## Federated baselines

* This code contains several baselines to be used for federated learning problems, including ADMM and BNN implementations. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jparras/fed-baselines).
