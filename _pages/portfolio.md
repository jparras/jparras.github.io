## Deep Reinforcement Learning teaching codes

* These codes are used for my teaching courses on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The codes are minimal implementations, intended for teaching, and available [here](https://github.com/jparras/drl_classes). The codes include:
    * Basic methods and examples to understand MDPs.
    * Classic RL methods, including iterative methods, model-free tabular methods and linear approximations.
    * Model-free DRL methods: DDQN, VPG, A2C, TRPO, DDPG, SAC.
    * Model-based DRL methods: AlphaZero.

## Deep Generative Models teaching codes

* These codes are used for my teaching courses on Deep Generative Models. The codes are minimal implementations, intended for teaching, and available [here](https://github.com/jparras/dgm_classes). The codes include:
    * Simple models, intended to understand the basic principles underlying a Generative Model, as well as classical methods used for sampling.
    * DGM models: VAE, GAN.

## Random Signals teaching codes

* These codes are used in my teaching on Random Signals. The codes are explained in Spanish, and are available [here](https://github.com/jparras/salt). 

## Federated baselines

* This code contains several baselines to be used for federated learning problems, including ADMM and BNN implementations. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jparras/fed-baselines).
