PhD in Telecommunication Engineering, currently Professor at [UPM](https://www.upm.es/), where I teach [courses](../teaching) on Statistics and Machine Learning, both at Degree and Master level.

My main research interest focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Optimal Control and Signal Processing methods applied to different fields. Although right now I am focused on medical applications, I have also applied these tools to Autonomous Navigation, Cybersecurity, Communications, Industrial applications and Audio Separation. For a more detailed view, you can check my [publications](../publications).

Finally, you can find more details on my [CV](../cv).

## Students
